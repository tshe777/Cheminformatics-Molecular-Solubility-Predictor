# Cheminformatics-Molecular-Solubility-Predictor

This project is based on a research article (by John S. Delaney) by applying Linear Regression to predict the solubility of molecules in water, or similar physiological environments. This project was inspired by Chanin Nantasenamat. 

Dataset(s) used:
  * [ESOL:â€‰ Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci034243x)

Scikit-learn, rdkit, and pandas were used.
