# Cheminformatics-Molecular-Solubility-Predictor

This project is based on a research article (by John S. Delaney) by applying Linear Regression to predict the solubility of molecules in water, or similar physiological environments. This project was inspired by Chanin Nantasenamat. 

Scikit-learn, rdkit, and pandas were used.
